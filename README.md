# Artificial-Intelligence-Pattern-Recognition
Project: Pattern Recognition
4 steps

First, change the image to 2D array.Gray-level image which was created by digitizing a picture which contains 2 objects. One is a rectangle, another is a circle.
Binary image after applying [histogram analysis] and [thresholding].
Before we can do pattern recognition we need to apply a [Connectivity Analysis] to identify the regions in the binary image, and assign a number to each region.
Compute attributes and recognize objects. (Note: we assume that only two types of obecjts exist in the image, one is circular object, another is seqaure object).
